        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            The STEAM Builders Club is a student‑led service and innovation club at
            <strong>Whispering&nbsp;Pines&nbsp;School</strong> in Florida, a K–12 Emotional &amp; Behavioral
            Disabilities (EBD) program. Our students—ranging from elementary through high school—
            possess incredible potential but often struggle with focus, emotional regulation and
            behaviors that have left them several grade levels behind academically. We are committed
            to <em>growing leaders and building community powered by STEAM</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rather than defining students by their challenges, we create an environment where
            reflection, accountability, creativity and care for others are nurtured. When mistakes are
            discussed non‑judgmentally and truthfully, students begin to take ownership of their growth
            and discover what they are capable of achieving.

        <h2>Mission &amp; Vision</h2>
        <p>
            At the heart of our work is 3D printing and technology. For many of our students, this is
            the first time school feels exciting, meaningful and future‑focused. When an idea becomes a
            real object in their hands, something shifts—students describe it as fun, cool and
            engaging. Approximately 80&nbsp;% of our students show increased motivation and
            participation when working with 3D design and printing, and we are building structures to
            reach even more learners.
        </p>
        <p>
            But STEAM Builders is not just about learning technology—it is about service. Students use
            3D printing and UV resin crafts as tools to uplift others by creating small gifts, tokens
            of appreciation and eventually functional and profitable items that give back to the school
            community. Even the smallest creations spark wonder and pride because they demonstrate that
            something made by a student can bring joy to a staff member or meet a real need.
        </p>
        <h3>Our Long‑Term Vision</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Help feed students who miss breakfast or lunch.</li>
            <li>Support staff in need through acts of kindness and assistance.</li>
            <li>Host student‑inspired events such as staff luncheons, treat days and community gatherings.</li>
            <li>Build sustainable, student‑run fundraising via meaningful 3D‑printed products.</li>
            <li>Reinvest all growth back into students, staff and shared experiences like field trips and celebrations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="quote">We build selflessly to uplift others — because as we uplift others, we uplift ourselves.</p>

        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <p>
            Although the club is still in its foundation stage, the impact is already visible—in
            student excitement, in staff reactions and in the relationships beginning to form between
            students and adults who may never have connected this way before. Many of our students
            report that 3D printing is the first time school has felt truly interesting and relevant
            to their future.
        </p>
        <p>
            By empowering students who are often overlooked to serve, create and contribute, we help
            them gain confidence and a sense of purpose. As students realize they can make a
            difference for others, everything changes.

            environment that sets high expectations and enables all students to achieve their maximum
            potential. Through collaboration among teachers, families and community stakeholders, the
            school addresses the academic, social, emotional and behavioral needs of students from
            diverse backgrounds. This supportive environment promotes a positive self‑concept and
            prepares students to become productive citizens in today’s challenging society.

        <h3>Our Core Beliefs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We treat everyone with respect and dignity, remain sensitive to individual differences
                and work together toward common academic, behavioral and therapeutic goals to create
                a safe environment that meets the needs of students, staff and families.</li>
            <li>Positive relationships and individual potential are cultivated by maintaining adequate
                student–staff ratios and supporting each learner’s unique strengths.</li>
            <li>The working and learning environment should provide the necessary structure and
                resources to ensure physical safety and well‑being.</li>
            <li>There should be ongoing opportunities for continuous learning and personal and
                professional growth for staff, students and families.</li>
        </ul>
