        <h2>Support &amp; Ordering</h2>
        <p>
            There are two ways you can support the STEAM Builders Club:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Donate:</strong> Scan the QR code below to make a contribution. Every dollar
                goes directly toward student‑led projects, supplies and acts of kindness. (Replace
                the placeholder QR code with your own when you are ready.)
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Order 3D‑printed products:</strong> Our students design and produce a variety
                of items—from custom keychains to classroom tools—which can be purchased through the
                official county system used by local high schools or at our school events. We will
                provide ordering links and schedules as they become available.
            </li>
        </ul>
